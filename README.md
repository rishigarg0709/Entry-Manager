# How to use it ðŸ“–
### Host Page

Firstly our application will ask for Host Details like his Name, Email and Password.

### Dashboard

Our Application will now ask Visitor wether he wants to Checkin or Checkout and he will choose option accordingly.
Also we have given a option of 'change host' by which a new user can become a host

If host has already checked in his information then our application will automatically redirect us to Dashboard page otherwise it will redirect us to Host Page

### Checkin Page

Our Application will ask visitor to enter his details like Name, Email and Phone Number which when submited will trigger an email to the email id provided by the host.

If visitor enters an email id which is already checked in but not checked out then it will not trigger any email.

### Checkout Page

Our Application will ask visitor to enter his details like Email id and Address visited which when submited will trigger an email to the visitor himself providing him his details like name, email, phone number, Checkin Time, Checkout Time, Host Name and Address visited.
